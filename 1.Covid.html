											<h3>Project Overview</h3>
											<p>This dashboard,developed as my inaugural analytics project, provides a comprehensive overview of the global pandemicâ€™s impact. It begins by presenting key global statisticsâ€”including total cases, recoveries, and fatalities to offer a quick snapshot of the situation worldwide. A heat map follows, visually representing the percentage of the population infected in each country, with darker shades indicating higher infection rates. A subsequent bar graph compares total deaths across continents, highlighting Europe as having the highest fatalities and Oceania the lowest. Finally, a line graph tracks the evolution of the infection rate over time, delivering valuable insights into how the pandemic has progressed.</p>
											<p>This was my first data analysis project, guided by a YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst" target="_blank">AlexTheAnalyst</a>. Feel free to click on the Github repository link to see more.</p>

											<h3>Objective</h3>
											<p>Clean, Manipulate, explore and visualize COVID-19 data to provide insights into the pandemic's impact.</p>
											<p>Create a comprehensive pandemic dashboard integrating data into Tableau.</p>
											<hr>
											<h3>Features</h3>
											<p>SQL Techniques: Utilizes joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, creating views, and data type conversions.</p>
											<p>Data Analysis: Queries to identify infection and death rates, likelihood of death from COVID-19, and comparison of death counts across continents.</p>
											<p>Advanced SQL Features: Includes rolling sums of vaccinations, intermediate calculations using CTEs and temporary tables, and creation of views for future visualizations.</p>

														<h5><b>Global Infected Numbers</b></h5>
														<p>The Analysis of Global Numbers of Infection from SARS-CoV-2 shows that out 775 million cases world wide 7 million resulted in death resulting in a .91% fatality rate. This could be due to the fact that this analysis was done after Covid had been studied and vaccines were created resulting in a plateu in the number of deaths.</p>

												  <div class="tile">
													<div class="tile-text">
														<h5><b>Total Deaths per Continent</b></h5>
														<p>The Analysis of Percent Population infected per country shows that regions with like Africa or South America had a lower Infection rate compared to Regions like North America and Europe. This could be from lack of data during the beginning of Covid.</p>
													  </div>

													<div class="tile-text">
														<h5><b>Percent Population Infected</b></h5>
														<p>The Analysis of Percent Population Infected shows that there was a gradual and consitent spike in Infections in 2021 and a much stepper raise in infections in 2022. This could reflect the impact of initial waves of the pandemic and subsequent measures to control it.</p>
